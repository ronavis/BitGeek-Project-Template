## Development Guidelines

1. **Ticket Integration**:
   - Every feature must have a corresponding ticket (e.g., `TICKET-XXX`)
   - Link the ticket number in parentheses next to each feature
   - Update this document when tickets are created

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Mark features as complete using [x] instead of [ ]
   - Include percentage estimates for partially complete features: [ ] Feature (75%)
   - Update during sprint reviews or milestone completions

3. **Prioritization**:
   - Features are listed in order of implementation priority
   - Reorganize as priorities shift, but document the changes in tickets

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Ad-hoc scripts must reference ticket numbers: `TICKET-XXX_feature_name.py`
   - Ensure consistency between ticket names and features listed here
